o About this software.

phylo3D is a set of packages for converting phylogenetic trees in 
New Hampshire (also called Newick or Phylip) format, New Hampshire Extended, NEXUS and the NCBI taxonomy database into LibSea format.
 
LibSea format can be read by Walrus a java-based graph visualization tool 
that can visualise graphs with several thousand nodes in 3D hyperbolic space. 
Thus, phylo3D makes it possible to visualise "huge" phylogenetic trees in 
3D hyperbolic space.

The advantage of visualising huge trees in this way is that it provides a 
focus+context view of the phylogenetic tree.

Walrus was developed by Young Hyun at the Cooperative Association for 
Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) and is available in binary form upon request 
from CAIDA (http://www.caida.org/tools/visualization/walrus).
